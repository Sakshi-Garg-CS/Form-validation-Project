# Form Validation Project

This is a front-end form validation system built with:
- ✅ HTML
- ✅ CSS (Custom styling and Bootstrap)
- ✅ JavaScript (Event listeners, validation logic)

The form validates:
- Full Name
- Email ID
- Phone Number
- Password
- Confirm Password

Validation includes real-time feedback and error messages based on specific rules without using any external JavaScript libraries.
